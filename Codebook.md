==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers 
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 
3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have 
been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has 
been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was 
selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by 
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of
2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal,
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a 
Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, 
a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and 
frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

##The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions 
are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the 
activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from 
the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row 
shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' 
and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained 
by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured 
by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

##QUESTIONS

 Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average
 of each variable for each activity and each subject.
